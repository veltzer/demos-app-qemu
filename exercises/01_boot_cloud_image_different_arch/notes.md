The UEFI firmware (QEMU_EFI.fd) is needed because it serves as the system's BIOS/firmware for the virtual ARM64 machine. When you're running an ARM64 system under QEMU, you need:

1. A way to initialize the virtual hardware
2. A way to load and start the operating system
3. A firmware interface that the operating system expects

The UEFI firmware provides all of these functions. Without it, the virtual machine wouldn't be able to:
- Initialize the virtual hardware properly
- Load the Linux kernel from the disk
- Provide necessary UEFI services that modern operating systems expect

This is why we use the `-bios QEMU_EFI.fd` parameter in the QEMU command. It's equivalent to having UEFI firmware on a physical computer's motherboard.

If you tried to start the VM without the UEFI firmware, you'd likely get an error or the system wouldn't boot because there would be no way to initialize the virtual hardware and bootstrap the operating system.

The Ubuntu ARM64 cloud image is specifically built expecting UEFI boot, which is the standard for ARM64 servers and most modern systems. This differs from legacy x86 systems which could fall back to BIOS boot.
