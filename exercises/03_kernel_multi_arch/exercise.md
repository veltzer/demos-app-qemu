**Objective:** Set up and use GDB to debug a running kernel in QEMU.

**Steps:**
1. Compile a kernel with debugging symbols.
2. Start QEMU with GDB stub enabled.
3. Connect GDB to the running QEMU instance.
4. Set breakpoints in key kernel functions (e.g., `do_fork`).
5. Trigger the breakpoints and examine the kernel state.

**Challenge:** Use GDB python extensions to create a custom command for analyzing process states.

## 3. QEMU Device Model Exploration

**Objective:** Understand and modify a QEMU device model.

**Steps:**
1. Examine the source code of a simple QEMU device (e.g., the "edu" device).
2. Modify the device to add a new register or functionality.
3. Recompile QEMU with your changes.
4. Write a kernel module that interacts with your modified device.
5. Test the kernel module in the modified QEMU.

**Challenge:** Implement a basic character device driver that interfaces with your modified QEMU device.

## 4. Kernel Tracing with QEMU and ftrace

**Objective:** Use QEMU to boot a kernel with ftrace enabled and analyze kernel behavior.

**Steps:**
1. Configure and compile a kernel with ftrace support.
2. Boot the kernel in QEMU with appropriate command-line options for ftrace.
3. Enable tracing for specific kernel functions.
4. Perform actions that trigger the traced functions.
5. Analyze the trace output to understand kernel behavior.

**Challenge:** Use ftrace to identify and optimize a performance bottleneck in a kernel subsystem.

## 5. QEMU Networking Deep Dive

**Objective:** Explore various QEMU networking modes and their impact on kernel network stack.

**Steps:**
1. Set up QEMU VMs using different networking modes (user, tap, bridge).
2. Analyze the kernel's view of the network in each mode.
3. Implement a simple network protocol in the kernel.
4. Test the protocol across VMs in different networking configurations.

**Challenge:** Set up a software-defined network using Open vSwitch and QEMU, and test kernel networking in this environment.

## 6. QEMU Block Device Performance Testing

**Objective:** Compare performance of different QEMU block device types and their impact on kernel I/O.

**Steps:**
1. Create disk images in various formats (raw, qcow2, vmdk).
2. Boot a kernel in QEMU using these different disk types.
3. Write a kernel module to perform disk benchmarking.
4. Compare I/O performance across different virtual disk types.
5. Analyze how the kernel's I/O scheduler behaves with different QEMU disk types.

**Challenge:** Implement a custom QEMU block driver and compare its performance to existing drivers.

## 7. Kernel Memory Management Analysis with QEMU

**Objective:** Use QEMU to study and optimize kernel memory management.

**Steps:**
1. Boot a kernel in QEMU with various memory sizes.
2. Write a kernel module that allocates and manipulates large amounts of memory.
3. Use QEMU's memory tracing features to analyze memory access patterns.
4. Experiment with different kernel memory management parameters.
5. Optimize your kernel module based on the analysis.

**Challenge:** Implement a custom memory management scheme in the kernel and compare its performance to the default.

These exercises cover a range of topics and skills that are valuable for kernel developers working with QEMU. They progress from basic usage to more advanced topics, allowing developers to gradually build their expertise.
